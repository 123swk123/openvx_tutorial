# Khronos OpenVX Tutorial Material
[OpenVX](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vx/) is a royalty-free open standard API released by the Khronos Group in 2014.
OpenVX enables performance and power-optimized computer vision functionality,
especially important in embedded and real-time use cases. The course covers both
the function-based API and the graph API that enable OpenVX developers to efficiently
run computer vision algorithms on heterogeneous computing architectures. A set of example
algorithms from computational photography and advanced driver assistance mapped to the
graph API will be discussed. Also covered is the relationship between OpenVX and OpenCV,
as well as OpenCL. The tutorial includes hands-on practice session that gets the participants
started on solving real computer vision problems using OpenVX.

## Tutorial Exercises
All the tutorial exercises are kept in tutorial_exercises folder. The tutorial_exercises/CMakeLists.txt includes
all the exercises as separate projects. It is best to start doing these exercises after going over the tutorial presentations.
  * exercise1: framework basics, import media, run a keypoint detector
  * exercise2: graph concepts, keypoint tracking
  * exercise3: user kernels, build a wrapper kernel to OpenCV function
  * exercise4: user kernels, build a keypoint tracker
  * easy_exercise*: partial solution with lot of hints in the code (use it only if you find exercise1/exercise2/... are hard)
  * solution_exercise*: complete solution of exercises (just for reference)

All of the exercise folders contain only one .cpp file with main() as the entry point. All the include files are kept in the include folder.
  * Look for TODO keyword in comments to code snipets that you need to write.
  * Walk through the code from top to bottom and follow the instructions in the comments.
  * The "opencv_camera_display.h" is a wrapper for importing media and displaying results using OpenCV library.
  * The "VX/vx.h" & "VX/vxu.h" are part of OpenVX header files directly from [Khronos OpenVX registry](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vx/)

## Tutorial Preperations using CMake
In order to work with these exercises, you need the following:
  * Laptop with a recent 64-bit OS (Windows, OS X, or Linux)
  * Download and install [OpenCV 3.1](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)
  * Recommended IDE: Qt Creator (OS X/Linux) or Visual Studio 2013/2015 (Windows)
  * [Khronos OpenVX sample implementation](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vx/) (recommended), or any other OpenVX open-source implementation, or any pre-built 3rd party OpenVX libraries. See [Khronos OpenVX Resources](https://www.khronos.org/openvx/resources) for available implementations.

The HOME/openvx_tutorial/tutorial_exercises/CMakeLists.txt supports the following cmake variables:
  * OpenVX_SOURCE_DIR:   OpenVX open-source implementation directory that has CMakeLists.txt
  * OpenVX_LIBS:         list of OpenVX libraries
  * OpenVX_LIBS_DIR:     path to OpenVX libraries
  * OpenVX_INCLUDE_DIRS: path to non-khronos OpenVX header files (optional)

Here are few cmake build examples to use for tutorial preperation:
  * Build exercises using pre-installed khronos sample binaries in VM
      * cmake HOME/openvx_tutorial/tutorial_exercises
  * Build exerciese using an open source implementation without using OpenCL
      * pushd HOME/openvx_tutorial/tutorial_exercises
      * git clone https://github.com/GPUOpen-ProfessionalCompute-Libraries/amdovx-core
      * popd
      * cmake -DOpenVX_SOURCE_DIR=amdovx-core/openvx -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_OpenCL=TRUE HOME/openvx_tutorial/tutorial_exercises
  * Build exerciese using a 3rd-party OpenVX library
      * cmake -DOpenVX_LIBS_DIR=*path-to-openvx-libraries* -DOpenVX_LIBS=*list-of-openvx-libraries* HOME/openvx_tutorial/tutorial_exercises


## Tutorial Preperations using Virtual Box
The first version of the virtual machine, used at CVPR 2015, was prepared with contributions from
Colin Tracey (NVIDIA), Elif Albuz (NVIDIA), Kari Pulli (Intel), Radha Giduthuri (AMD), Thierry Lepley (NVIDIA),
Victor Eruhimov (Itseez), and Vlad Vinogradov (Itseez).

The current version of VirtualBox VM has been updated to use the exercises in this project. You should setup your computer before starting the tutorial.
  * Choose a laptop with a recent 64-bit OS.
  * Download and install a recent VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.
  * Download virtual machine "Ubuntu-64-OpenVX.zip" (2 GB) from https://goo.gl/3HRmdi and extract files into a local folder.
  * Run VirtualBox and add "Ubuntu-64-OpenVX" virtual machine [Machine -> Add] from the local folder. If you canâ€™t install 64-bit VM,
  even though you have a 64-bit Windows, you need to enable virtualization in the BIOS. In the Security section,
  enable Virtualization Technology and VT-d Feature. On Windows 8.1, you also need to turn Hyper-V off
  (search for Turn Windows features on or off).
  * Start the "Ubuntu-64-OpenVX" virtual machine.
  * Run "Qt Creator" (click Qt icon on left) and open project /home/openvx/openvx_tutorial/tutorial_exercises/CMakeLists.txt.
  * Build and run to make sure a window opens playing a video. Press ESC to stop the app.
